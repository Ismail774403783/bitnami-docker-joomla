# What is Joomla?

> Joomla is a PHP content management system (CMS) for publishing web content. It includes features such as page caching, RSS feeds, printable versions of pages, news flashes, blogs, search, and support for language international.

# Prerequisites

To run this application you need Docker Engine 1.10.0. Docker Compose is recomended with a version 1.6.0 or later.

# How to use this image

## Run Joomla with a Database Container

Running Joomla with a database server is the recommended way. You can either use docker-compose or run the containers manually.

### Run the application using Docker Compose

This is the recommended way to run Joomla. You can use the following docker compose template:

```
version: '2'

services:
  mariadb:
    image: 'bitnami/mariadb:latest'
    volumes:
      - 'mariadb_data:/bitnami/mariadb'
  application:
    image: 'bitnami/joomla:latest'
    ports:
      - '80:80'
      - '443:443'
    volumes:
      - 'joomla_data:/bitnami/joomla'
      - 'apache_data:/bitnami/apache'
      - 'php_data:/bitnami/php'
    depends_on:
      - mariadb

volumes:
  mariadb_data:
    driver: local
  joomla_data:
    driver: local
  apache_data:
    driver: local
```

### Run the application manually

If you want to run the application manually instead of using docker-compose, these are the basic steps you need to run:

1. Create a new network for the application and the database:

  ```
  $ docker network create joomla_network
  ```

2. Start a MariaDB database in the network generated:

  ```
  $ docker run -d --name mariadb --net=joomla_network bitnami/mariadb
  ```

  *Note:* You need to give the container a name in order to Joomla to resolve the host

3. Run the Joomla container:

  ```
  $ docker run -d -p 80:80 --name joomla --net=joomla_network bitnami/joomla
  ```

Then you can access your application at http://your-ip/

## Persisting your application

If you remove every container and volume all your data will be lost, and the next time you run the image the application will be reinitialized. To avoid this loss of data, you should mount a volume that will persist even after the container is removed. If you are using docker-compose your data will be persistent as long as you don't remove `mariadb_data` and `application_data` data volumes. If you have run the containers manually or you want to mount the folders with persistent data in your host follow the next steps:

> **Note!** If you have already started using your application, follow the steps on [backing](#backing-up-your-application) up to pull the data from your running container down to your host.

### Mount persistent folders in the host using docker-compose

This requires a sightly modification from the template previously shown:
```
version: '2'

services:
  mariadb:
    image: 'bitnami/mariadb:latest'
    volumes:
      - '/path/to/your/local/mariadb_data:/bitnami/mariadb'
  application:
    image: 'bitnami/joomla:latest'
    ports:
      - '80:80'
      - '443:443'
    volumes:
      - '/path/to/your/local/joomla_data:/bitnami/joomla'
      - '/path/to/your/local/apache_data:/bitnami/apache'
      - '/path/to/your/local/php_data:/bitnami/php'
    depends_on:
      - mariadb
```

### Mount persistent folders manually

In this case you need to specify the directories to mount on the run command. The process is the same than the one previously shown:

1. If you haven't done this before, create a new network for the application and the database:

  ```
  $ docker network create joomla_network
  ```

2. Start a MariaDB database in the previous network:

  ```
  $ docker run -d --name mariadb -v /your/local/path/bitnami/mariadb/data:/bitnami/mariadb/data -v /your/local/path/bitnami/mariadb/conf:/bitnami/mariadb/conf --net=joomla_network bitnami/mariadb
  ```

  *Note:* You need to give the container a name in order to Joomla to resolve the host

3. Run the Joomla container:

  ```
  $ docker run -d -p 80:80 --name joomla -v /your/local/path/bitnami/joomla:/bitnami/joomla --net=joomla_network bitnami/joomla
  ```

# Upgrade this application

Bitnami provides up-to-date versions of MariaDB and Joomla, including security patches, soon after they are made upstream. We recommend that you follow these steps to upgrade your container. We will cover here the upgrade of the Joomla container. For the MariaDB upgrade see https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-mariadb/blob/master/README.md#upgrade-this-image

1. Get the updated images:

```
$ docker pull bitnami/joomla:latest
```

2. Stop your container

 * For docker-compose: `$ docker-compose stop joomla`
 * For manual execution: `$ docker stop joomla`

3. (For non-compose execution only) Create a [backup](#backing-up-your-application) if you have not mounted the joomla folder in the host.

4. Remove the currently running container

 * For docker-compose: `$ docker-compose rm -v joomla`
 * For manual execution: `$ docker rm -v joomla`

5. Run the new image

 * For docker-compose: `$ docker-compose start joomla`
 * For manual execution ([mount](#mount-persistent-folders-manually) the directories if needed): `docker run --name joomla bitnami/joomla:latest`

6. You need to complete the upgrade from the browser to get latest Joomla version.

# Configuration
## Environment variables
 When you start the joomla image, you can adjust the configuration of the instance by passing one or more environment variables either on the docker-compose file or on the docker run command line. If you want to add a new environment variable:

 * For docker-compose add the variable name and value under the application section:
```
application:
  image: bitnami/joomla:latest
  ports:
    - 80:80
  environment:
    - JOOMLA_PASSWORD=my_password
  volumes_from:
    - application_data
```

 * For manual execution add a `-e` option with each variable and value:

```
 $ docker run -d -e JOOMLA_PASSWORD=my_password -p 80:80 --name joomla -v /your/local/path/bitnami/joomla:/bitnami/joomla --net=joomla_network bitnami/joomla
```

Available variables:

 - `JOOMLA_USERNAME`: Joomla application username. Default: **user**
 - `JOOMLA_PASSWORD`: Joomla application password. Default: **bitnami**
 - `JOOMLA_EMAIL`: Joomla application email. Default: **user@example.com**
 - `MARIADB_USER`: Root user for the MariaDB database. Default: **root**
 - `MARIADB_PASSWORD`: Root password for the MariaDB.
 - `MARIADB_HOST`: Hostname for MariaDB server. Default: **mariadb**
 - `MARIADB_PORT`: Port used by MariaDB server. Default: **3306**


### SMTP Configuration

To configure Joomla to send email using SMTP you can set the following environment variables:
 - `SMTP_HOST`: SMTP host.
 - `SMTP_PORT`: SMTP port.
 - `SMTP_USER`: SMTP account user.
 - `SMTP_PASSWORD`: SMTP account password.
 - `SMTP_PROTOCOL`: SMTP protocol.

This would be an example of SMTP configuration using a GMail account:

 * docker-compose:

```
  application:
    image: bitnami/joomla:latest
    ports:
      - 80:80
    environment:
      - SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
      - SMTP_PORT=587
      - SMTP_USER=your_email@gmail.com
      - SMTP_PASSWORD=your_password
```

 * For manual execution:

```
 $ docker run -d -e SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com -e SMTP_PORT=587 -e SMTP_USER=your_email@gmail.com -e SMTP_PASSWORD=your_password -p 80:80 --name joomla -v /your/local/path/bitnami/joomla:/bitnami/joomla --net=joomla_network bitnami/joomla
```

# Backing up your application

To backup your application data follow these steps:

1. Stop the running container:

* For docker-compose: `$ docker-compose stop joomla`
* For manual execution: `$ docker stop joomla`

2. Copy the Joomla data folder in the host:

```
$ docker cp /your/local/path/bitnami:/bitnami/joomla
```

# Restoring a backup

To restore your application using backed up data simply mount the folder with Joomla data in the container. See [persisting your application](#persisting-your-application) section for more info.
